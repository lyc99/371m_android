    <string name="help_description">Welcome to bracketApp! Not only is the lack of a clever name a work in progress, but this app is definitely one too. Nonetheless, you
                                    are currently able to construct a bracket size of 16, 8, or 4 and place the names of the players at the first part of the bracket. While this
                                    may not be much, it is a great starting point for an app we hope to account for most (if not all) of your tournament organizing needs.</string>
